 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 free software — to make sure the software is free for all its users.
 Our “General Public Licenses” are intended to guarantee these rights
 for software; this “Lesser” license provides additional rights.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), applies to
 certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary
 General Public License.  We use this license for certain libraries so
 that the libraries can be used by non-free programs.  But we restrict
 the use of the libraries in other ways to preserve your rights.

  When a program is linked with the library, whether statically or
 using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking
 a combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
 General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
 entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
 Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
 the library.

  In detail, these conditions apply to you if you distribute copies of
 the library, or if you modify it.

                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
                           DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
    program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
    other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms
    of this Lesser General Public License (also called “this License”).
    Each licensee is addressed as “you”.  A “library” means a collection
    of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently
    linked with application programs (which use some of those functions
    and data) to form executables.  The “Library”, below, refers to any
    such software library or work which has been distributed under these
    terms.  A “work based on the Library” means either the Library or
    any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
    containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
    modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another
    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation
    in the term “modification”.)  “Source code” for a work means the
    preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For a
    library, complete source code means all the source code for all
    modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
    plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of
    the library.  Activities other than copying, distribution and
    modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its
    scope.  The act of running a program using the Library is not
    restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its
    contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the
    use of the Library in a tool for writing it).

 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library’s
    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
    that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
    intact all notices that refer to this License and to the absence
    of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with
    the Library. You may charge a fee for the physical act of
    transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
    protection in exchange for a fee.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge
       to all third parties under the terms of this License.
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
       is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
       in the event an application does not supply such function or
       table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part
       of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a
       library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely
       well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,
       Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or
       table used by this function must be optional: if the application
       does not supply it, the square root function must still compute
       square roots.)

 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To
    do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,
    so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License,
    version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than
    version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared,
    then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not
    make any other change in these notices. Once this change is made in
    a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU
    General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
    derivative works made from that copy.

 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative
    of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
    terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with
    the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object
    code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place,
    then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same
    place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
    though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with
    the object code.

 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library,
    but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked
    with it, is called a “work that uses the Library”. Such a work, in
    isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls
    outside the scope of this License. However, linking a “work that
    uses the Library” with the Library creates an executable that is a
    derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the
    Library), rather than a “work that uses the library”. The executable is
    therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for
    distribution of such executables. When a “work that uses the Library”
    uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the
    object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even
    though the source code is not. Section 6 requires that:

 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a
    “work that uses the Library” with the Library to produce a work
    containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under
    terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of
    the work for the customer’s own use and reverse engineering for
    debugging such modifications. You must do the following:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
       source code for the Library including whatever changes were used
       in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library,
       with the complete machine-readable “work that uses the Library”,
       as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify
       the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing
       the modified Library. It is understood that the user who changes the
       contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be
       able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy
       of the library already present on the user’s computer system, rather
       than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will
       operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user
       installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible
       with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three
       years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection
       6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this
       distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
       designated place, then offer equivalent access to copy the above
       specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials,
       or that you have already sent this user a copy.

 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
    side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities
    not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library,
    provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library
    and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and
    provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
       the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must
       be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part
       of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find
       the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to
    copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void,
    and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
    parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License
    will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
    full compliance.

 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
    However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
    Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if
    you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
    Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of
    this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
    distributing
    or modifying the Library or works based on it.

 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
     the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor
     to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms
     and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
     recipients’ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible
     for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
     conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
     excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
     distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
     License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
     may not distribute the Library at all. [...]

 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
     countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
     copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an
     explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
     so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
     excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
     written in the body of this License.

 13. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and “any later version”, you have the option of following the
     terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
     published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not
     specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever
     published by the Free Software Foundation.

 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with
     these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which
     is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
     Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.

 NO WARRANTY

 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
     FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
     OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
     PROVIDE THE LIBRARY “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
     EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
     WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.

 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
